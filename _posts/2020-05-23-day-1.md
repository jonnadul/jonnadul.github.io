# Day One
Amazon does this interesting thing where they attach every earnings report with a copy of their first ever earnings report back when they were still just selling books online. Bezos do this not to pay homage to his company but to serve as a reminder that it is always Day One.

In his own words.
_"Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death...And that is why it is always Day 1."_

Setting aside the obvious startup-y tropes I have always found this personally motivating to treat everyday as an opportunity to grow and create. Whether its learning a new programming language, running a 5k, **or starting a new blog**. Through this exercise, I hope to gain a better understanding of the many moving pieces that makeup the technology world and a space for me to contribute back in the little ways that I can.

Anyways enough of that, here we go!
